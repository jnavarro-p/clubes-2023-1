You already used a `numpy` function in Module 4, when you generated a random number for the guessing game!\n","\n","**Modules are a collection of tools written in python** that is maintained and developed by the community. Often these modules come by default with any installation of python. However, if it exists on the internet, you can likely download it and use it.\n","\n","Two common modules that are, by default, downloaded when you install python include `numpy` and `matplotlib`. We will focus on `numpy` here, but you will get an introduction to plotting with `matplotlib` in a later lesson.\n","\n","### So `numpy` is a module, or a collection of code. How do we use it?\n","\n","To use a module, you use the keyword `import`, which will load that module. Importing tells python to give you access to the code in that module. You can also import specific functions to save time if you don't need access to the entire module.\n","\n","It is traditional when importing `numpy` to rename it to `np` using the `as` keyword. For example, the code would be\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","```\n","Notice the blue words are the python \"keywords\", basically saying that they have special meaning (and you can't use them as variable names).\n","\n","Literally everyone renames `numpy` as `np`. This saves some typing and the meaning is clear. In fact, you can rename any module to anything you like using the `as` keyword, but it's useful to follow convention. If you do not use `as`, the module will be imported but not renamed.\n","\n","*Let's try it out.*\n","\n","Typically, people put all their imports in a cell at the top of their notebooks.
